## 📌 Project Description
CryptoHarbor is a decentralized registry where users can submit and showcase their blockchain-based project ideas. It acts as a harbor where new ideas “dock,” become discoverable, and evolve with community involvement.

- **User Project Tracking:** Each wallet address can submit and store one project entry.

## 🔭 Future Scope

- Allow project metadata (description, tags, links).
- Introduce rating or upvote features.
- Add governance for community-curated top projects.
- Integrate with decentralized storage (IPFS/Arweave).
